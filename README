h1. Sufi

The worlds best internal coffee system to resolve conflicting issue of ordering coffee. Built using Angular JS and Rails as a backend

h2. Project structure

The project has been structured in such a way that the angular code sits in the ngapp folder leaving rails as a completely isolated backend.

Its important to stress the benefit of this structure as it keeps the frontend and backend separate making, which effectively increases development
and draws a clear distinction between the two technologies used.

h2. Yeoman, Grunt, Bower and Karma JS Runner

Sufi has a Angular front-end that has been constructed using Yeoman. A subset of tools to make web development fun and exciting. Yeoman consist of three
following tools:

* [Yo](https://github.com/yeoman/yo)- Scaffolds out a new application whilst writing to the Gruntfile.
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) - Javascript task runner that manipulates web apps.
* [Bower](http://bower.io) - Package manager for the web that allows you to add additional functionality.
* [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) - Ruby on Rails open source web framework to bring happiness.

h2. Getting Started

h3.Setting up environment

* Ruby version 2.0.0
* Rails version 4.0.0

Visit: http://railsinstaller.org/en to install latest version

* Nodejs
* Node Package Manager (npm)

Visit: http://nodejs.org/ to install

h3. Running rails backend

```
rvm use 2.0.0
git clone https://github.com/aaronmason/sufi
cd sufi

Set up `database.yml` which should be located in app/config/ example below

development:
  adapter: sqlite3
  database: db/development.sqlite3
  pool: 5
  timeout: 5000

test:
  adapter: sqlite3
  database: db/test.sqlite3
  pool: 5
  timeout: 5000

production:
  adapter: sqlite3
  database: db/production.sqlite3
  pool: 5
  timeout: 5000


bundle exec rake db:migrate
bundle install
bundle exec rails s
```

h3. Setting up Grunt server

```
nvm use 0.10.13 (should be the latest)
cd suf/ngapp
npm install -g yo
nom install -g bower
npm install -g generator-webapp
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
bower install angular-ui
npm install --save-dev connect-livereload
bower install
npm install
Inside Ruby Command Prompt cd to app and `gem install compass`
grunt server (Will run on port 3000)
grunt (Prepare app for deployment)
```

h3. Angular + Rails diagram

![Application Layout](http://i.imgur.com/NbY4ELb.jpg "Application Layout")

The purpose of this setup is to simulate the whole environment in a single web application. Before pushing to production
the whole angular will sit inside rails' app/public

The grunt server should be bale to proxy any url with the path to the rails backend on localhost:3000 by doing [Gist](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6462007)
the above snippet will sit inside the Gruntfile.js so that when the grunt server is run any reference to the api will look up localhost:3000


h2. Testing

To run the tests for the front-end for angular do the following:

```
cd ngapp
node scripts/web-server.js (Starts webserver)
Open browser and redirect to http://localhost:8000/test/e2e/runner.html
```
